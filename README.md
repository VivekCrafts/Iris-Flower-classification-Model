This project is a simple implementation of a machine learning model to classify the Iris dataset into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers. Each sample has four features:
1.Sepal Length
2.Sepal Width
3.Petal Length
4.Petal Width

This project uses a Logistic Regression Model to classify the Iris flowers based on the given features. This model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.

Also designed the app using Streamlit.
